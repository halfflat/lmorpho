# `lmporho` â€” generate random neuron morphologies

`lmorpho` implements an L-system geometry generator for the purpose of
generating a series of artificial neuron morphologies as described by a set of
stasticial parameters.

This code derives from discontinued earlier work in the [Arbor](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor) project.

_This is a placeholder README, to be expanded as the project progresses beyond a stub._
